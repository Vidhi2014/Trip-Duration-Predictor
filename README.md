# Trip-Duration-Predictor
In this project various attributes of a trip are taken into consideration for predicting the total duration of the trip. For achieving this, I implemented machine learning models like Random Forest, Extra Gradient Boosting, Natural Spline etc. in R and their performances were compared.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project was derived and modified from the following kaggle dataset.
